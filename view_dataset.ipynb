Cervical spondylosis.\"\\n\\nFINDINGS:  Regrettably, a sagittal STIR sequence was not included in the\\npresent imaging protocol.  However, the available sequences do not show a\\nT2 signal abnormality within the C6 vertebral body which, if present, would\\nsuggest that there is an acute compression fracture.  Supporting this\\ncontention is the lack of observable prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this\\nand other locales within the cervical spine.\\n\\nAt C3-4, there is a hypointense structure, which appears to represent a rather\\ntortuous left vertebral artery which nearly fills the left C3-4 neural\\nforamen.\\n\\nAt C4-5, there is a shallow posterior spondylitic ridge without cord\\ncompression, but uncovertebral spurring produces moderate left foraminal\\nstenosis.  There is a small anterior bridging osteophyte.\\n\\nAt C5-6, there is a moderate left paracentral posterior spondylitic ridge\\ncausing slight flattening of the ventral cord margin, more to the left of\\nmidline, with uncovertebral spurring causing moderate left-sided foraminal\\nstenosis.  There is a moderate-sized anterior bridging osteophyte.\\n\\nAt C6-7, there is a moderate left paracentral posterior spondylytic ridge\\ncontacting the left ventral lateral cord margin, with uncovertebral spurring\\ncausing prominent left-sided foraminal stenosis.  There is also a small\\nanterior bridging osteophyte seen.\\n\\nAt C7-T1, uncovertebral spurring produces moderately prominent left-sided\\nforaminal stenosis.  There is no other overt cervical spinal or paraspinal\\npathology seen.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:  Cervical spondylosis with multilevel foraminal stenosis,\\npredominantly left sided as noted above.\\n\\nCOMMENT:  We spoke about these findings by telephone.  Regarding the left\\nvertebral artery, MR angiography, performed without contrast could easily\\ndefine the course of the left vertebral artery, and more conclusively exclude\\nan aneurysm.  At that time, for completeness, a sagittal STIR image could be\\nobtained encompassing the cervical spine to provide more conclusive exclusion\\nof any bone edema which might be seen in the presence of an acute fracture. \\nThere is no mention in either the patient\\'s history or conversation that in\\nactuality, any fall had occurred which could cause a fracture.\\n\\nINDICATION:  ___ woman with left shoulder pain and arm pain.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed on the 1.5 Tesla magnet.

A fibroid on the\\nright measures 3.2 cm. The endometrium is homogenous and measures 6 mm. A\\nfocal echogenic area within the endometrium is noted measuring 1.1 cm, best\\nseen on the transverse images, consistent with a polyp.\\n\\nIn the left adnexa there is a 6.9 x 6.0 x 5.4 cm slightly heterogeneous lesion\\nwithout increased internal vascularity, of unclear origin.  The lesion is\\nwithout separation from the uterus. This likely represents an exophytic\\nfibroid, although a definite origin from the uterus could not be demonstrated.\\nThe left ovary cannot be visualized. The right ovary and adnexa are\\nunremarkable. There is no free fluid.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\n1.  Large left adnexal mass, which may represent an exophytic fibroid or an\\novarian lesion.

There are multiple\\nintramural fibroids, each T2 hyperintense, T1 isointense to myometrium and\\nheterogeneously hyperenhancing. The largest fibroid is seen within the\\nposterior superior uterine segment, with partial exophytic extent posteriorly\\nas well as the anterior mass effect on the endometrial cavity. This has\\nmaximum diameter 3.3 cm.\\n\\nVisualized in zonal anatomy of the uterus and cervix area unremarkable. There\\nis minimal T2 hypointense material within the endometrial cavity at the fundus\\n(3:16 and 5:10).  The post contrast evaluation of this area is limited by\\nbowel motion, therefore differentiating clot from proliferatives changes is\\ndifficult.\\n\\nThere is a 7.0 x 6.3 x 7.9 cm left adnexal mass. This has inferior and\\nrightward mass effect on the uterus. This structure is predominantly T2\\nhypointense with some internal foci of high signal.  It is intermediate on T1\\nweighted imaging, with mild heterogeneity.  The mass is predominantly\\nhypoenhancing to nonenhancing, which in conjunction with the T2 appearance is\\nmost suggestive of a fibrous tumor, such as fibroma or fibrothecoma.  However,\\nthere are several enhancing nodules, which are atypical for this diagnosis,\\nand therefore epithelial neoplasm is not excluded.  The central 7mm nodule is\\nprogressively and avidly enhancing (903:51), while peripheral nodules\\ndemonstrate very mild enhancement (903:39 and 53)\\n\\nThe right ovary is normal in size, but decreased in T2 signal and demonstrates\\na low T2 rim.  This appearance is most suggestive of an involuting post\\nmenopausal ovary with superficial cortical fibrosis.  However,  if left\\novarian surgery is to be performed, visual inspection of the left ovary is\\nrecommended to exclude bilateral ovarian lesions.\\n\\nThere is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  Osseous structures are\\nunremarkable.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: \\n\\n1) 7.9cm left ovarian mass.  There are some imaging features suggestive of\\nthis being a fibroma/fibrothecoma, with other features atypical for this\\ndiagnosis.  As such, other epithelial or non-epithelial  neoplasms are not\\nexcluded and surgical consultation is warranted.\\n\\n2) Low signal of the right ovary, likely on the basis of postmenopausal\\ninvolution and superficial cortical fibrosis.  Direct inspection at the of\\nsurgery is recommended.\\n\\n3) Multifibroid uterus with material within the endometrial cavity at the\\nlevel of the fundus.  Given poor evaluation of this area on post contrast\\nsequences, this study cannot reliably differentiate between blood products and\\nproliferative change.\\n\\nEXAMINATION:  US MAJOR JOINT ASP./INJ.

Linear atelectasis is seen at\\nthe left costophrenic angle.  No consolidation or edema is noted.  The\\nmediastinum is unremarkable.  The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits\\nfor size.  No effusion or pneumothorax is noted.  Mild degenerative disease is\\nseen throughout the lower thoracic spine as well as in bilateral\\nacromioclavicular joints.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Left base atelectasis.  Otherwise, no acute pulmonary process.\\n\\nLEFT SHOULDER THREE VIEWS, ___ AT 12:03 HOURS\\n\\nHISTORY:  Left shoulder pain.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  None.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  The proximal humerus is intact.  The glenohumeral and\\nacromioclavicular joints are grossly unremarkable.  There is mild degeneration\\nin the acromioclavicular joint with small downward projecting osteophytes.  A\\ntiny curvilinear well-corticated bony fragment projects just cephalad to the\\ndistal clavicle.  This is apparently the site of pain as denoted by an\\nadjacent BB placed by the radiology technologist.  The acromiohumeral and\\ncoracoclavicular intervals are appropriate.  The regional soft tissues are\\nunremarkable.  The visualized adjacent lung is clear.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  No gross traumatic injury identified.  Please note, given the\\nlocalization of pain at the acromioclavicular joint, a grade 1\\nacromioclavicular separation cannot be entirely excluded.  There are baseline\\nacromioclavicular degenerative changes with small downward projecting\\nosteophytes which could play a role in impingement syndrome.  Correlate\\nclinically.  If indicated, consider MRI on a nonurgent basis for further\\nevaluation.\\n\\nINDICATION:  Severe left shoulder pain with no history of trauma.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Shoulder radiograph dated ___.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Imaging was performed at ___.  Sequences include axial,\\nsagittal, and coronal T1, T2, proton density and fat saturated images through\\nthe left shoulder.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  There is a trace amount of fluid within the acromioclavicular joint\\nand mild irregularity of the articular surfaces (3:36 and 5:6).  Only a trace\\namount of edema is seen within the distal clavicle and acromion.  The inferior\\nband of the acromioclavicular ligament appears intact.  The superior band is\\nnot well visualized.  The coracoclavicular ligaments are intact.  There is a\\nlarge amount of edema within the trapezius and deltoid muscles.\\n\\nThe supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles and\\ntendons are intact.\\n\\nThe biceps labral anchor is intact and the biceps tendon courses within the\\nbicipital groove.  There is a ___ complex of the anterior labrum and\\nMGHL.  \\n\\nThere is no joint effusion or bone contusion.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Trace fluid in the acromioclavicular joint with minimal\\nirregularity of the articular surfaces and large amount of edema in the\\ntrapezius and deltoid muscles.  The spectrum of findings could be seen in the\\nsetting of acute injury as in a grade 1 sprain of the acromioclavicular joint.\\nHowever, given the absence of any history of trauma the findings are\\nconsistent with nonspecific myositis of the trapezius and deltoid muscles. \\nGiven the trace amount of fluid in the acromioclavicular joint superimposed\\ninfection in this region cannot be excluded.  The amount of fluid would not be\\namenable to image-guided joint aspiration.  This would be an atypical location\\nfor diabetic myonecrosis.\\n\\nFindings discussed with Dr. ___ on ___ at 9:20 a.m.\\n\\nINDICATION:  ___ man with left shoulder and trapezius pain, evaluate\\nfor focal fluid collection or aspiration.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  None.\\n\\nULTRASOUND OF THE LEFT SHOULDER OVER THE REGION OF PAIN:  There is no evidence\\nof focal fluid collection around the region of pain.

There is subcutaneous edema, mainly laterally (4, 31), and there is\\nalso edema seen within the quadriceps muscles, primarily involving the vastus\\nlateralis and vastus medialis muscles (4, 39), though mild edema is also seen\\nwithin the rectus femoris.  The greatest focal area of intramuscular edema\\nbegins roughly 9 cm below the left femur greater trochanter, and extends along\\na nearly 15 cm area in the lateral aspect of the quadriceps (6, 18). \\nFollowing contrast administration, there is mild enhancement seen within the\\nvastus intermedius and vastus lateralis centered in this area (8, 80).  There\\nis no focal fluid collection.  There is no rim enhancement or other sign of\\nabscess formation.\\n\\nThe underlying marrow signal is within normal limits.  Visualized portions of\\nthe adductor and hamstrings groups appear unremarkable.  Visualized portions\\nof the right proximal thigh are grossly unremarkable.  There is incidental\\nnote made of trace joint effusion within the bilateral knees, though this area\\nis incompletely evaluated.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Myositis involving the left quadriceps groups, most severely\\naffecting the left vastus lateralis and vastus medialis as detailed above. \\nDifferential considerations include infectious and inflammatory myositis,\\nincluding drug reaction, as well as diabetic myonecrosis.  No evidence of\\nfocal fluid collection or other sign of abscess formation.\\n\\nULTRASOUND-GUIDED ASPIRATION OF THE LEFT ACROMIOCLAVICULAR JOINT, ___.\\n\\nCLINICAL HISTORY:  Acromioclavicular joint swelling.\\n\\nPROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to MRI from ___, and prior\\nultrasound from ___.\\n\\nInitial diagnostic ultrasound images of the acromioclavicular joint confirmed\\nthe presence of moderate degenerative changes, with associated capsular\\nhypertrophy, and apparent mild synovial proliferation.  No definite fluid was\\nidentified within the joint, but given clinical concern, aspiration was\\nperformed.\\n\\nFollowing discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure,\\nwritten informed consent was obtained.  Preprocedure timeout was performed.\\n\\nAfter standard sterile prep and local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, a 21-gauge\\nneedle was advanced into the left acromioclavicular joint under continuous\\nultrasound guidance.  Intra-articular position was visually confirmed. \\nAspiration was attempted, but no fluid could be yielded.  Needle was then\\nexchanged for a 19-gauge needle, and lavage was performed with a total of 2 mL\\nof sterile saline, and approximately 1.5 mL was then re-aspirated, and sent\\nfor microbiology analysis.  Insufficient amount was aspirated to send for cell\\ncount or chemistry.\\n\\nNeedle was removed.  Pressure was held until hemostasis was achieved.  Dry\\nsterile bandage was applied.\\n\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  No immediate complications.

Possible mediastinal mass.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was coordinated with\\nintravenous infusion of Optiray 350 nonionic iodinated contrast agent\\nreconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal\\nand paramedian sagittal images, read in conjunction with chest radiographs\\nfrom ___ and ___.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  \\n\\nIrregular peribronchial soft tissue infiltration in the right upper lobe\\nextends upward from the upper pole of the right hilus into the apical segment,\\ncontinuous with mild, permeatice lymph node enlargement in hilus that\\nmarginates but does not impinge on the arch of the azygos vein.  The orifice\\nto the posterior segment of the right upper lobe bronchus is severely narrowed\\naccounting for most of the moderate degree of volume loss in the right upper\\nlobe responsible for anterior migration of the major fissure and slight\\nrightward shift of the mediastinum.  A spiculated 13 mm wide nodule in the\\nright upper lobe abuts the major fissure, 3:24.  Another 5.4 mm wide\\nspiculated nodule is close to the minor fissure, 3:28, a 7 mm wide nodule is\\ndeeper in the right middle lobe, 3:34, a 6-mm right lower lobe nodule is\\nwithin 2 cm of the posterior costal pleural surface, 3:38, and a very dense,\\nalmost mass-like lesion with consolidative features in the posterior segment\\nof the right lower lobe, 29 x 18 mm, abuts the paraspinal pleura separated by\\na 4 mm wide subpleural nodule, 3:34.\\n\\nPrevascular lymph nodes at the thoracic inlet range in size up to 10 mm, 2:14,\\nright lower paratracheal nodes are 9.5 mm wide and diaphragmatic nodes in the\\nright cardiophrenic sulcus, are 6 mm across.  A chain of nodes extending from\\nthe left lower paraspinal to the retrocrural space measure up to 11 mm across,\\n2:53.  However the largest lymph nodes are in the abdomen including a 22 mm\\nwide left gastric node and a dozen periaortic retroperitoneal nodes ranging up\\nto 27 mm across.  This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation\\nexcept to note a homogeneous liver and no adrenal mass although the left\\nadrenal is difficult to separate from adjacent adenopathy. There is no\\nspleen, and no vascular clips to support the presumptive explanation of\\nsplenectomy.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Interpretation of findings would depend upon clinical history,\\nfor example, has the patient had splenectomy for lymphoma or CLL?  The chest\\nradiograph requisition from ___ cites a history of neurosarcoid.\\n\\nA unifying diagnosis for severe abdominal adenopathy, less extensive\\nintrathoracic lymph node enlargement and multiple lung lesions including\\nnodules, extensive peribronchial infiltration (the right upper lobe lesion\\nwhich prompted this CT scan) and mass-like consolidation includes lymphoma and\\nsarcoidosis.  Any one of the lung lesions however could be a bronchogenic\\ncarcinoma.

Heart size is normal.\\n\\nAP PORTABLE CHEST, ___, AT 1703 HOURS.\\n\\nHISTORY:  Pulmonary sarcoid, post-cervical mediastinoscopy with right upper\\nlobe VATS wedge resection.  Assess for location of right chest tube.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, apically directed chest tube is\\nnoted overlying the right hemithorax with the distal tip in the extreme apex. \\nAgain noted is an ill-defined area of opacity medially in the right apex\\nadjacent to chain sutures, presumably the result of the recent wedge\\nresection.  Lung volumes globally are diminished.  There is ill-defined\\npredominantly linear opacity in the left lateral lung base with blunting of\\nthe left costophrenic angle.  There is minimal tortuosity of the thoracic\\naorta.  The cardiac silhouette size is stable.  No pneumothorax is visible. \\nThe osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  Apically directed right chest tube.  The ill-defined opacity has\\nbeen previously characterized on CT.  There may be additional opacity\\ncontributed by the recent surgery.  The opacity at the left lung base is\\nnonspecific but more characteristic of atelectasis with possibly a small\\neffusion.

No\\ninterval recurrence of focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. \\nNormal size of the cardiac silhouette.\\n\\nINDICATION:  A ___ man status post right upper lobe wedge resection.\\nPlease rule out pneumothorax.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from ___.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  Faint line at the right apex paralleling the second posterior rib\\nmost likely represents a rib companion shadow rather than pleural line.  There\\nis no evidence of pneumothorax.  Unchanged opacity in the right upper lobe,\\nconsistent with post-surgical changes or residual lung mass. There is a tiny\\nright pleural effusion.  The mediastinum and hila are normal.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  There is no pneumothorax.  Unchanged right upper lobe opacity,\\nlikely post-surgical changes.\\n\\nPA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___\\n\\nHISTORY:  Right upper lobe nodule and mediastinoscopy.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:\\n\\nPost-biopsy bleeding and atelectasis in the right upper lobe continues to\\nclear.  There is no pneumothorax and only minimal right pleural effusion,\\nprobably unchanged.  Fullness in the right lower paratracheal station is\\ndifficult to separate from overlying manubrium, but not changed in the\\ninterim.  Heart size is normal.  Left lung is clear.  Left nipple should not\\nbe mistaken for a lung nodule.\\n\\nEXAM:  CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast obtained ___.\\n\\nHISTORY:  History of sarcoid based on prior lung and mediastinal lymph node\\nbiopsy, presenting with abdominal pain and incontinence.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Nonenhanced transaxial images from the lung bases to the pelvis\\nwere obtained with routine protocol.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nPatchy mass-like opacities are noted within the right and left lung bases,\\nwithin the right base, the lesion measures 7 x 12 mm, and is slightly\\nincreased in size when compared to the prior study.  Within the medial aspect\\nof the left lung base, posteriorly, abutting the pleura is a 2.1 x 1.5 cm\\npatchy area of opacity which is also increased in size in the interval.  The\\nvisualized portion of the heart is unremarkable in appearance.  There are\\ncoronary artery calcifications.  Bilateral gynecomastia is noted.\\n\\nLack of intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the solid intra-abdominal\\norgans.  However, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenal glands are\\ngrossly unremarkable in appearance.  There is a tiny 1-mm non-obstructing\\nright interpolar renal calculus.  Additionally, there is an approximately 3-mm\\nright interpolar renal calculus.  Otherwise, the kidneys are unremarkable in\\nappearance.  The patient does not have a spleen.\\n\\nVisualized bowel is grossly unremarkable in appearance without bowel wall\\nthickening, inflammatory changes, or obstruction.\\n\\nNoted diffusely throughout the mesentery, intraperitoneal, retroperitoneal,\\nbilateral internal and external iliac chains, and inguinal regions are\\nextensive adenopathy.  These lymph nodes are large, some measuring up to 2.5\\ncm in size.  When compared to the partially imaged abdomen from the chest CT\\nof ___, these lymph nodes have increased in size.\\n\\nThere is no free intraperitoneal air or fluid.  No free pelvic fluid.\\n\\nThe prostate gland is visualized with a few calcifications.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of osseous destructive lesions.\\n\\nThe abdominal aorta has a normal course and caliber.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\n1.  Extensive intra-abdominal and pelvic lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes\\nmeasuring up to 2.5 cm in size.  Given the disparity in size of the\\nmediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy, a biopsy is recommended to confirm\\nsarcoid as a diagnosis and exclude other process such as lymphoma.\\n\\n2.

There is no\\nmass effect or midline shift.  There is no hydrocephalus or acute ischemia.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nStable white matter lesions which are nonspecific regarding etiology and most\\nlikely represent small vessel ischemic sequela in the setting of underlying\\nhypertension or diabetes.  Given history of sarcoid, these lesions could also\\nrepresent manifestation of neurosarcoid.\\n\\nINDICATION:  Sarcoid, cough, fever and left lower lobe rales.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  PA lateral radiograph of the chest.\\n\\nCOMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  Changes consistent with right-sided wedge resection are again seen.\\nThe opacifications in the right upper lobe that have a fibrotic appearance on\\nthe current study are decreased in density.

No other\\ndefinite worrisome osseous lesions are identified.\\n\\nINDICATION:  ___ woman with headache last night and right-sided\\nnumbness, weakness and slurring in the morning, now resolved.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  ___.  \\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No\\ncontrast was administered.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally\\nmidline structures or evidence of major vascular territorial infarct.  The\\ngray-white differentiation is preserved.  Basilar cisterns are preserved.\\nVentricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.  There is no\\nfracture.  Mastoid air cells are normally aerated.\\n\\nIMPRESSIONS:  No intracranial hemorrhage or other acute abnormality.  However,\\nMRI is more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia.\\n\\nHISTORY:  ___ female with new onset right-sided numbness and weakness,\\nprior history of smoking and colon cancer, to rule out intrathoracic\\npathology.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were performed. \\nComparison is made with CT chest of ___ and chest radiograph of ___.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\nThere are background changes of COAD with no evidence of an acute\\ncardiopulmonary process.\\n\\nCLINICAL HISTORY:  ___ female with right-sided numbness and weakness.\\nEvaluate for infarct.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  None.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain\\nwere obtained.  3D and 2D time-of-flight MR arteriography was performed of the\\ncircle of ___ and neck, respectively.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  An 11-mm focus of restricted diffusion is identified in the left\\nparamedian pons, which on corresponding FLAIR and T2 images show bright signal\\nconsistent with subacute infarct.  There is no hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or\\nshift of normally midline structures.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in\\ncaliber and configuration.  Scattered T2 and FLAIR signal abnormality in the\\nperiventricular and subcortical white matter reflect chronic microvascular\\nischemic change.

There is defect in the left pons\\ncorresponding to an infarction identified on the MR ___.  There\\nis no abnormal enhancement after contrast administration.  No other diffusion\\nabnormalities are noted.  This was performed as a brain MR, rather than a\\nstudy of the orbits.  However, the images of the orbits included in this\\nexamination appear normal.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:  Old left pontine infarct corresponding to the lesion detected on\\n___.  The study is otherwise normal.  There is no evidence of\\nmasses or edema.  Specifically, the limited views of the orbits appear normal.\\n\\nHISTORY:  ___ woman with history of stroke and ataxia.  According to\\nprior studies, the patient also has a history of colon cancer.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  MRI of the brain ___.  Non-contrast\\nhead CT ___, and ___.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT was obtained.\\n\\nFINDINGS:  There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally\\nmidline structures or edema.  Periventricular and hypoattenuating foci are\\ncompatible with small vessel ischemic disease.  Gray-white matter\\ndifferentiation is preserved.  Left pontine hypodensity corresponds to the\\ninfarct identified on MRI of ___. The ventricles, basal cisterns,\\nand sulci are normal in size and configuration. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid\\nair cells are well aerated.  The orbits and surrounding soft tissues appear\\nwithin normal limits.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.\\n2.  Old left pontine infarct corresponds to lesion detected on ___.\\n\\nHISTORY:  ___ woman with ataxia.\\n\\nCOMPARISON:  Chest x-rays of ___, and ___.  CT of the chest ___.  Prior studies indicate that the\\npatient's history of colon cancer.\\n\\nCHEST, TWO VIEWS:  Lung volumes are low which results in bronchovascular\\ncrowding and extent and accentuates the cardiac silhouette.  Within this\\nlimitation, the lungs are clear, without airspace consolidation.  Hilar\\ncontours, and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits.  Osseous\\nstructures are intact.  Surgical clips within the left upper quadrant are\\nnoted.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process.\\n\\nEXAM:  MRI brain.  MRA head.  MRA neck.\\n\\nCLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with gait instability.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion axial images\\nof the brain were acquired.  3D time-of-flight gadolinium-enhanced MRA of the\\nneck and 3D time-of-flight MRA of the head were obtained.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\n\\nBRAIN MRI:\\n\\nThere is evidence of restricted diffusion seen in the right lenticulostriate\\nterritory extending from the putaminal to the periventricular region.
