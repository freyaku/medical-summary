Goals of care: The patient expressed that her desire to ""let go"" and be at peace. She is tired of ""fighting"" her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on ___. Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in-house and at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES ============== Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting. HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were continued in-house and at discharge. COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued in-house and at discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture [ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new) [ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. ___. [ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement and code status.

You were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. Because of your repeated paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement.

For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on ___ was reassuring. On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own.

The patient reports that he was at the ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred to ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic changes. Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient was transferred for further care. In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr 36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and metoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.

The lungs are adequately aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch calcifications. The heart is top normal in size. ___ ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI. Epistaxis, nasal fractures Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. NSTEMI Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin. Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. -monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge. Acute kidney injury Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The patient was discharged with a stable creatinine. Peripheral vascular disease Patient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease (possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). -Repeat echocardiogram in ___ years to monitor mild AS/AR. -If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray. -Repeat chest x-ray in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL infiltrative process. -Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later evaluation of nasal fractures. -Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and platelets. -Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for ease-of-administration.
