    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, nn.Module is a base class for all neural network modules. It is a fundamental building block for creating neural network architectures. When you create a custom neural network in PyTorch, you typically subclass nn.Module and define the network's layers and operations within this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### nn.Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nn.Dropout` layer is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent the network from relying too much on any particular set of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The argument `0.1` in `nn.Dropout(0.1)` specifies the probability of dropping out each neuron during training. In this case, `0.1` means that each neuron in the input will be set to zero with a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) during each forward pass through the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "During inference (i.e., when the model is used to make predictions), dropout is typically turned off or scaled appropriately to ensure that the expected output remains the same. This scaling is often achieved automatically in PyTorch when using `nn.Dropout` with the `model.eval()` mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `nn.Dropout(0.1)` introduces random dropout with a probability of 0.1 during training to prevent \n",
    "overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the neural network."

You came to us with  stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we  did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We  also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to  help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we  discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to  make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high  enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess  fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr.  Peatah Puhkah in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy  and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us.  We wish you all the best! Your Peatah Puhkah Team.     Followup Instructions: Peatah Puhkah\n"

Diuretics were recently decreased  due to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Held spironolactone for  now due to K 5.2 and increased lasix 20 -> 40. No evidence of  severe hyponatremia (Na<120) or renal failure Cr>2.0 to stop  diuretics at present. Diagnostic paracentesis negative for  infection. Ascitic total protein 0.3 so warrants SBP prophylaxis  (<1.0) and fortunately already on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis  which would be appropriate for SBP ppx also.

History of HE from Hep C cirrhosis.  Now with mild encephalopathy (hallucinations and forgetfulness)  due to medication noncompliance, but not acutely encephalopathic  and without asterixis on exam. Infectious workup negative thus  far. Continue lactulose 30mL TID and titrate to 3 BMs daily and  continue rifaximin 550mg BID.     HYPONATREMIA. Na 125 on admission, 128 four days ago, and 135  one month ago. Likely due to third spacing from worsening  ascites and fluid overload. 1.5L fluid restriction, low salt  diet. S/p therapeutic paracentesis with albumin replacement.   CIRRHOSIS, HEPATITIS C. MELD score of 10 and Child's Peatah Puhkah  class B on this admission. Now decompensated due to ascites.  Hepatitis C genotype IIIB. Dr. Peatah Puhkah starting  Peatah Puhkah and Peatah Puhkah with patient in clinic and the  insurance process was started by her office.

Altered mental status improved with lactulose. Hypotension was  felt to be due to fluid shifts from paracentesis on the day  prior to admission as well as low PO intake in the setting of  AMS. Hypotension and Peatah Puhkah resolved with IV albumin. Hyperkalemia  resolved with insulin and kayexalate.   Hypotension: Patient presented with SBP in Peatah Puhkah and improved  with albumin in the ED to Peatah Puhkah. It was felt to be due to  fluid shifts from paracentesis on Peatah Puhkah, as well as likely  hypovolemia given AMS and decreased PO intake. No concern for  bleeding or sepsis with baseline CBC and lack of fever. She  continued to received IV albumin during her hospital course,  with which her SBP improved to Peatah Puhkah and patient remained  asymptomatic.     Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with K 6.7 with EKG changes.  Given low Na, likely the result of low effective arterial volume  leading to poor K excretion, with likely exacerbation from Peatah Puhkah.  AM cortisol was normal. K improved with insulin and kayexalate  and K was 5.2 on day of discharge. Bactrim was held during  hospital course.    Peatah Puhkah: Patient presented with Cr 0.7 from baseline Cr is  0.3-0.4. It was felt to be likely due to volume shift from her  paracentesis on the day prior to admission as well as now low  effective arterial volume, likely Peatah Puhkah poor PO intake Peatah Puhkah AMS. Cr  improved to 0.4 with albumin administration. Furosemide and  Bactrim were held during hospital course.     GOC: The Peatah Puhkah son (HCP) met with Dr. Peatah Puhkah  outpatient hepatologist) during Peatah Puhkah hospital course. They  discussed that the patient is not a transplant candidate  givenevere underlying lung disease (FEV1 ~0.8), hypoxia, RV  dilation and very low BMI. A more conservative approach was  recommended and the patient was transitioned to DNR/DNI. The  patient agreed with this plan. She was treated with the goal of  treating any any correctable issues. Social work met with the  patient prior to discharge. The patient was interested in  following up with palliative care, for which an outpatient  referral was made.     Altered Mental Status: Patient presented with confusion that  was most likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Based on  outpatient records, patient has had steady decline in  decompensated cirrhosis and mental status. No signs of infection  and head CT was negative as well. Mental status improved with  lactulose in the ED and patient reports that she has not been  taking lactulose regularly at home. Patient was also continued  on rifaximin.      HCV Cirrhosis: Genotype 3a. Patient is decompensated with  increasing ascites and worsening hepatic encephalopathy. She is  dependent on twice weekly paracentesis. Spironolactone was  recently stopped due to hyperkalemia. Patient is not a  transplant candidate given her comorbidities COPD per outpatient  hepatologist. The patient would like to continue biweekly  paracenteses as an outpatient.   HIV: Most recent CD4 count 173 on Peatah Puhkah. HIV viral load on  Peatah Puhkah was undetectable. She was continued on her home regimen  of raltegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Bactrim  prophylaxis was held during admission because of hyperkalemia.       COPD: Patient on 3L NC at home. She was continued on her home  regimen.  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: -Follow up with Palliative Care as outpatient -Bactrim prophylaxis (HIV+) was held during hospital course due  to Peatah Puhkah. Consider restarting as outpatient. -Furosemide was held due to Peatah Puhkah, consider restarting as  outpatient -Follow up with hepatology -Continue biweekly therapeurtic paracenteses -Code status: DNR/DNI   Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. Peatah Puhkah,  You were admitted to Peatah Puhkah because of confusion, low blood  pressure, and a high potassium value. Your confusion improved  with lactulose. Your blood pressure improved with extra fluids  and your potassium improved as well. You also had small degree  of kidney injury when you came to the hospital, and this also  improved with fluids. While you were here, you discussed  changing your goals of care to focusing on symptom management  and treatment of reversible processes, such as an infection.

We also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. Peatah Puhkah in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. We wish you all the best! Your Peatah Puhkah Team. Followup Instructions: Peatah Puhkah \n",

Altered mental status improved with lactulose. Hypotension was felt to be due to fluid shifts from paracentesis on the day prior to admission as well as low PO intake in the setting of AMS. Hypotension and Peatah Puhkah resolved with IV albumin. Hyperkalemia resolved with insulin and kayexalate. Hypotension: Patient presented with SBP in Peatah Puhkah and improved with albumin in the ED to Peatah Puhkah. It was felt to be due to fluid shifts from paracentesis on Peatah Puhkah, as well as likely hypovolemia given AMS and decreased PO intake. No concern for bleeding or sepsis with baseline CBC and lack of fever. She continued to received IV albumin during her hospital course, with which her SBP improved to Peatah Puhkah and patient remained asymptomatic. Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with K 6.7 with EKG changes. Given low Na, likely the result of low effective arterial volume leading to poor K excretion, with likely exacerbation from Peatah Puhkah. AM cortisol was normal. K improved with insulin and kayexalate and K was 5.2 on day of discharge. Bactrim was held during hospital course. Peatah Puhkah: Patient presented with Cr 0.7 from baseline Cr is 0.3-0.4. It was felt to be likely due to volume shift from her paracentesis on the day prior to admission as well as now low effective arterial volume, likely Peatah Puhkah poor PO intake Peatah Puhkah AMS. Cr improved to 0.4 with albumin administration. Furosemide and Bactrim were held during hospital course. GOC: The Peatah Puhkah son (HCP) met with Dr. Peatah Puhkah outpatient hepatologist) during Peatah Puhkah hospital course. They discussed that the patient is not a transplant candidate givenevere underlying lung disease (FEV1 ~0.8), hypoxia, RV dilation and very low BMI. A more conservative approach was recommended and the patient was transitioned to DNR/DNI. The patient agreed with this plan. She was treated with the goal of treating any any correctable issues. Social work met with the patient prior to discharge. The patient was interested in following up with palliative care, for which an outpatient referral was made. Altered Mental Status: Patient presented with confusion that was most likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Based on outpatient records, patient has had steady decline in decompensated cirrhosis and mental status. No signs of infection and head CT was negative as well. Mental status improved with lactulose in the ED and patient reports that she has not been taking lactulose regularly at home. Patient was also continued on rifaximin. HCV Cirrhosis: Genotype 3a. Patient is decompensated with increasing ascites and worsening hepatic encephalopathy. She is dependent on twice weekly paracentesis. Spironolactone was recently stopped due to hyperkalemia. Patient is not a transplant candidate given her comorbidities COPD per outpatient hepatologist. The patient would like to continue biweekly paracenteses as an outpatient. HIV: Most recent CD4 count 173 on Peatah Puhkah. HIV viral load on Peatah Puhkah was undetectable. She was continued on her home regimen of raltegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. Bactrim prophylaxis was held during admission because of hyperkalemia. COPD: Patient on 3L NC at home. She was continued on her home regimen.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. Peatah Puhkah, You were admitted to Peatah Puhkah because of confusion, low blood pressure, and a high potassium value. Your confusion improved with lactulose. Your blood pressure improved with extra fluids and your potassium improved as well. You also had small degree of kidney injury when you came to the hospital, and this also improved with fluids. While you were here, you discussed changing your goals of care to focusing on symptom management and treatment of reversible processes, such as an infection. While you were in the hospital, you were seen by one of our social workers. You will also follow up with Palliative Care in their clinic and will continue to have therapeutic paracenteses.

Goals of care: The patient expressed that her desire to \"let go\" and be at peace. She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on Peatah Puhkah. Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent Peatah Puhkah paracentesis on Peatah Puhkah with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x 2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in-house and at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES ============== Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting. HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were continued in-house and at discharge. COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued in-house and at discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture [ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new) [ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. Peatah Puhkah. [ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement and code status.

Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. Peatah Puhkah, It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at Peatah Puhkah. You were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. Because of your repeated paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice. We wish you all the best! Your Peatah Puhkah care team Followup Instructions: Peatah Puhkah \n",

Chief Complaint: Visual hallucinations Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A History of Present Illness: Peatah Puhkah male with Peatah Puhkah disease, dyslipidemia, and a history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and visual hallucinations. The following history is taken from chart review: The patient was seen by his neurologist on Peatah Puhkah at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on Peatah Puhkah his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on Peatah Puhkah was reassuring. On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED. In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs Peatah Puhkah, normotensive, and SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease Peatah Puhkah strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no EKG changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications, and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted. On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He is not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is in the hospital and that it is Peatah Puhkah. He is not sure why he is here and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he mentions that he has not had a fall for Peatah Puhkah years. He denies any fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or dysuria.

The patient reports that he was at the Peatah Puhkah earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred to Peatah Puhkah for further care. There, a CT scan of the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic changes. Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient was transferred for further care. In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr 36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and metoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.

The lungs are adequately aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch calcifications. The heart is top normal in size. Peatah Puhkah ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Brief Hospital Course: Mr. Peatah Puhkah is an Peatah Puhkah with history of AAA s/p repair complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI. Epistaxis, nasal fractures Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. NSTEMI Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin. Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. -monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge. Acute kidney injury Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The patient was discharged with a stable creatinine. Peripheral vascular disease Patient had a history of AAA repair in Peatah Puhkah without history of MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease (possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). -Repeat echocardiogram in Peatah Puhkah years to monitor mild AS/AR. -If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray. -Repeat chest x-ray in Peatah Puhkah weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL infiltrative process. -Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later evaluation of nasal fractures. -Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and platelets. -Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for ease-of-administration.

The following history is taken from chart review: The patient was seen by his neurologist on Peatah Puhkah at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on Peatah Puhkah his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on Peatah Puhkah was reassuring. On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED. In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs Peatah Puhkah, normotensive, and SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease Peatah Puhkah strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no EKG changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC. Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications, and complete a toxo-metabolic workup.

      "Title: History of Present Illness, content: Mr. Peatah Puhkah is an Peatah Puhkah with history of AAA s/p repair complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents upon transfer from outside hospital with nasal fractures and epistaxis secondary to fall. The patient reports that he was at the Peatah Puhkah earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred to Peatah Puhkah for further care. There, a CT scan of the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic changes. Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient was transferred for further care. In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr 36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and metoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held. Past Medical\n",

Transferred here for closer monitoring and possible thrombectomy if her exam acutely worsens. History obtained from patient and daughter at bedside. Patient is an excellent historian. On Peatah Puhkah, she had dinner with friends and then returned to her apartment and was fooling around on her computer. Last known well was around 8:00 Peatah Puhkah. Then, she had an odd sensation and started throwing her arms around. She went to living room to sit down and tried to read but could not see the words very clearly. Then, two family members were knocking at the door and she had a tough time standing up to open door. She was able to eventually stand up with great difficulty and walked with her walker. She usually walks with a walker because of knee replacement. Finally, got up out of chair with walker and walked to the door to unlock. She noticed problems talking to family members. She had difficulty forming words and pronouncing words. Denies word finding difficulty. She could tell it was slurred like a person who had too much to drink. EMTs asked if she was intoxicated but she was not. She was very aware of her dysarthria and told her daughters that she thinks she's having a stroke. Then, she said she had trouble sitting down but has no idea why she thought that. When she was standing, she was able to walk with walker but she felt unsteady and almost fell. No visual changes. No numbness or tingling. Denies focal weakness; she just had trouble standing up. She was able to unlock her door without issue but she felt shaky. She was brought by EMS to Peatah Puhkah where NIHSS was 1 for slurred speech. There, she felt the same but her symptoms started to improve when she started to be transferred. Paramedics said her speech was improving rapidly en route. Last month, started needing naps. Her hearing is poor at baseline and she normally uses hearing aids. For the past Peatah Puhkah months, she has had Peatah Puhkah nocturia nightly. No dysuria. She has noticed more frequent headaches lately in the past Peatah Puhkah months. Last headache was yesterday. She takes tramadol and acetaminophen up to a couple times a night. She reports headaches at night which wake her up. She denies that the headache is positional; it is the same sitting up or lying down. She has had some gradual weight loss over the past ~12 months; Peatah Puhkah year ago she was almost 140 lbs, and now she is Peatah Puhkah lbs. Her appetite is still good and she enjoys eating but she is less hungry that she used to be. Daughter says that she has had marked decline in memory in past Peatah Puhkah weeks. Over past few years, she has been forgetting plans, times for pickpup, and dinner plans, which has become normal. Over the past Peatah Puhkah weeks, family has noticed dramatic worsening.

His wife placed him on the couch, but he got back up and fell in the bathroom - again he denies any LOC or head trauma, blaming his instability and Peatah Puhkah weakness. He had no tongue biting or loss of bowel/bladder continence. He went to bed last night, but the morning of presentation his wife was concerned about his falls and brought him to the ED.

During her recent hospitalization she was ruled out for an MI with three negative sets of cardiac enzymes, she had a stress echo which showed inducible ischemia at the achieved workload, thought to be single vessel disease per the echo report. At that time the plan was for medical management, given her severe underlying pulmonary disease she was not started on a beta blocker, but was started on diltiazem 120mg daily.

Patient notes that Peatah Puhkah evening had a large seafood dinner which is not usual for her, and then later around 10pm had acute onset of SOB feeling like she could not take deep breaths with chest tightness (patient notes this is her \"angina\"). Denies pleuritic component to CP, described as central and across lower rib cage, persistent since onset, no radiation to the shoulders/jaw/back, no diaphoreses. Worsens with activity, improves somewhat with rest. Patient does not it feels like other episodes when she then required her stent placement. Took a SLNx1, which improved her symptoms though these persisted, but almost immediately led to abdominal discomfort with vomiting x1, nonbloody with dinner pieces. Peatah Puhkah, 1 day prior to admission, decided to see if her pain improved on its own, then when it persisted on Peatah Puhkah, husband arranged for UC appt at Peatah Puhkah Peatah Puhkah. At PCP, Peatah Puhkah, SBP up to 200s, EKG with ST depressions in the precordial leads, specifically V3, V4 and V5, given full dose ASA and SLNx1, and sent to the ED given concern for ACS versus HTN emergency. Patient reporting baseline sleeps with 2 pillows, unchanged recently, no cough, PND, orthopnea with 2 pillows. Worsening DOE since onset of symptoms, now unable to complete a block where she used to be able to walk a few blocks at a time without stopping Peatah Puhkah SOB/CP. Denies new Peatah Puhkah edema (baseline says L leg > R). Also had emesis last night x 1; no diaphoresis, no chest pain, no radiation of symptoms anywhere. No diarrhea or constipation, no dysuria, no focal weakness/numbness. On ROS, also with some L leg tingling intermittently, stable and chronic. Had diarrhea x1 on Peatah Puhkah following Peatah Puhkah seafood dinner, normal BMs since then. In the ED initial vital signs; T 98 P 88 BP 190/120 R 18 O2 Sat 98% 3L nasal cannula.

CXR showed no pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, or consolidation, borderline cardiomegaly. The patient received carvedilol, nebulizers, and IV lasix. It is unclear how much UOP the patient has as it was not documented in the ED. The patient was seen by cardiology in the ED who felt that in the setting of systolic heart failure, her dyspnea was likely due to a CHF exacerbation in the setting of dietary indiscretion. Diuresis was recommended in addition to increasing carvedilol to 12.5mg BID, as well as a nuclear stress test this morning. On the floor, the patient c/o of some improved dyspnea/chest tightness as well as wheezing (no COPD/asthma history, no significant smoking history), but otherwise has no acute complaints. Given her continued SOB and wheezing, she was written for nebulizers and steroids for reactive airway disease overnight. Past Medical\n"
