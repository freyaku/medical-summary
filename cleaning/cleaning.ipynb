    "### nn.Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, nn.Module is a base class for all neural network modules. It is a fundamental building block for creating neural network architectures. When you create a custom neural network in PyTorch, you typically subclass nn.Module and define the network's layers and operations within this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### nn.Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nn.Dropout` layer is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent the network from relying too much on any particular set of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The argument `0.1` in `nn.Dropout(0.1)` specifies the probability of dropping out each neuron during training. In this case, `0.1` means that each neuron in the input will be set to zero with a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) during each forward pass through the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "During inference (i.e., when the model is used to make predictions), dropout is typically turned off or scaled appropriately to ensure that the expected output remains the same. This scaling is often achieved automatically in PyTorch when using `nn.Dropout` with the `model.eval()` mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `nn.Dropout(0.1)` introduces random dropout with a probability of 0.1 during training to prevent \n",
    "overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the neural network."

As we discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. ___ in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. We wish you all the best!Your ___ Team.   FOLLOWUP INSTRUCTIONS:___\n"
