    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, nn.Module is a base class for all neural network modules. It is a fundamental building block for creating neural network architectures. When you create a custom neural network in PyTorch, you typically subclass nn.Module and define the network's layers and operations within this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### nn.Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nn.Dropout` layer is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks to prevent overfitting. It works by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent the network from relying too much on any particular set of features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The argument `0.1` in `nn.Dropout(0.1)` specifies the probability of dropping out each neuron during training. In this case, `0.1` means that each neuron in the input will be set to zero with a probability of 0.1 (or 10%) during each forward pass through the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "During inference (i.e., when the model is used to make predictions), dropout is typically turned off or scaled appropriately to ensure that the expected output remains the same. This scaling is often achieved automatically in PyTorch when using `nn.Dropout` with the `model.eval()` mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, `nn.Dropout(0.1)` introduces random dropout with a probability of 0.1 during training to prevent \n",
    "overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the neural network."

Transvaginal exam was performed \\nfor better evaluation of the uterus and adnexa. The endometrial \\nstripe measures 5 mm. The left ovary measures 3.5 x 1.6 x 1.8 \\ncm. The right ovary measures 2.9 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm. There is a \\nsmall echogenic focus within the right ovary measuring 5 x 4 x 4 \\nmm, likely a small hemorrhagic cyst. Both ovaries demonstrate \\nnormal arterial and venous waveforms.   \\nIMPRESSION:  \\n1. No evidence of ovarian torsion.  \\n2. Small right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. \\n.\\nCT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ___:  Scattered calcified \\ngranulomas in \\nthe lung bases are stable. There is no new focal pulmonary \\nnodule, \\nconsolidation, or effusion. The cardiac apex is within normal \\nlimits.  \\nComplete evaluation of the intra-abdominal viscera is limited by \\nthe \\nnon-contrast technique. However, the liver appears homogeneous \\nwithout focal lesion. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal \\ndilatation is identified.  The gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas \\nappear within normal limits. The adrenal glands are symmetric \\nwithout focal nodule. The kidneys appear homogeneous without \\nfocal lesion or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is \\nnon-aneurysmal throughout its visualized course. The second and \\nthird portions of the duodenum are equivocally thickened which \\nmay be due to underdistension. No small bowel obstruction is \\nidentified. The appendix is well visualized and is normal in \\nappearance. There is no free fluid or free air. \\n  \\nCT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ___: Initial images \\ndemonstrated a solid mass like abnormality in the cecal tip \\nmeasuring approximately 3 cm (2:51).  As this was potentially \\nconcerning for a cecal mass, rescanning of a limited portion of \\npelvis was performed after passage of oral contrast, confirming \\nthe finding and demonstrating a 3 cm mass with thickening of the \\nadjacent cecal wall (601:15). The adjacent appendix is normal \\nand there is no pericecal inflammatory change.  \\nThe remainder of the colon is normal without evidence of \\nobstruction or \\ninflammation. The surgical anastomosis within the lower midline \\npelvis \\nappears unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid. The uterus \\nand adnexa \\nappear within normal limits. The bladder is markedly distended \\nbut is \\notherwise unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or \\ninguinal lymph nodes are identified. \\nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture \\nis \\nidentified.  \\nIMPRESSION: \\n1. Findings consistent with a 3 cm cecal mass and thickening of \\nthe cecal tip concerning for neoplasm. Atypical infectious \\nprocess causing this appearance is felt less likely due to lack \\nof inflammatory stranding. Recommend colonoscopy for further \\nevaluation.  \\n2. Normal appendix, no signs of inflammation. \\n3. No small or large bowel obstruction. \\n4. Equivocal thickening of duodenum likely related to \\nunderdistention.  \\n\\nColonoscopy ___:\\nFindings:  \\n Lumen: Evidence of a previous end to end ___ \\nanastomosis was seen at the sigmoid colon.  \\n Protruding Lesions A ulcerated 3 cm mass of malignant \\nappearance was found in the cecum. The scope traversed the \\nlesion. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at \\nthe cecum.  \\n Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with small openings were \\nseen in the descending colon.  \\nImpression: Mass in the cecum (biopsy)\\nDiverticulosis of the descending colon\\nPrevious end to end ___ anastomosis of the sigmoid \\ncolon\\nOtherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum \\n.\\nPATHOLOGY:\\nDIAGNOSIS: \\n\"Cecal mass\", mucosal biopsies: \\nColonic mucosa with focal ischemic change and abundant \\nassociated ulceration, exudate, and granulation tissue \\nformation; no carcinoma or dysplasia in these samples.  Five \\nlevels are examined.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nThe patient is a ___ year-old female with history significant for \\ndiverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection in ___, who presented with \\nabdominal pain and was found to have cecal mass.  \\n.  \\n# Abdominal pain: Was most likely related to hemorrhagic ovarian \\ncyst.  Initially, patient had significant pain that was not \\nrelieved with dilaudid.  However, over the course of several \\ndays her pain resolved on its own and she no longer required any \\npain medications.  Bloodwork and imaging were not suggestive of \\nany intra-abdominal infection.  The patient was advised to \\nfollow-up with her gynecologist regarding her ovarian cyst, and \\nthe need for continued therapy with low dose oral contraceptive. \\n  \\n.  \\n# Cecal Mass: During the workup of this patient\\'s abdominal \\npain, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 3 cm cecal mass \\nconcerning for malignancy.

Transvaginal exam was performed for better evaluation of the uterus and adnexa. The endometrial stripe measures 5 mm. The left ovary measures 3.5 x 1.6 x 1.8 cm. The right ovary measures 2.9 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm. There is a small echogenic focus within the right ovary measuring 5 x 4 x 4 mm, likely a small hemorrhagic cyst. Both ovaries demonstrate normal arterial and venous waveforms.   IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of ovarian torsion.  2. Small right ovarian hemorrhagic cyst. .CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast ___:  Scattered calcified granulomas in the lung bases are stable. There is no new focal pulmonary nodule, consolidation, or effusion. The cardiac apex is within normal limits.  Complete evaluation of the intra-abdominal viscera is limited by the non-contrast technique. However, the liver appears homogeneous without focal lesion. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified.  The gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas appear within normal limits. The adrenal glands are symmetric without focal nodule. The kidneys appear homogeneous without focal lesion or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is non-aneurysmal throughout its visualized course. The second and third portions of the duodenum are equivocally thickened which may be due to underdistension. No small bowel obstruction is identified. The appendix is well visualized and is normal in appearance. There is no free fluid or free air.   CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST ___: Initial images demonstrated a solid mass like abnormality in the cecal tip measuring approximately 3 cm (2:51).  As this was potentially concerning for a cecal mass, rescanning of a limited portion of pelvis was performed after passage of oral contrast, confirming the finding and demonstrating a 3 cm mass with thickening of the adjacent cecal wall (601:15). The adjacent appendix is normal and there is no pericecal inflammatory change.  The remainder of the colon is normal without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. The surgical anastomosis within the lower midline pelvis appears unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid. The uterus and adnexa appear within normal limits. The bladder is markedly distended but is otherwise unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are identified. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture is identified.  IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with a 3 cm cecal mass and thickening of the cecal tip concerning for neoplasm. Atypical infectious process causing this appearance is felt less likely due to lack of inflammatory stranding. Recommend colonoscopy for further evaluation.  2. Normal appendix, no signs of inflammation. 3. No small or large bowel obstruction. 4. Equivocal thickening of duodenum likely related to underdistention.  Colonoscopy ___:Findings:   Lumen: Evidence of a previous end to end ___ anastomosis was seen at the sigmoid colon.   Protruding Lesions A ulcerated 3 cm mass of malignant appearance was found in the cecum. The scope traversed the lesion. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the cecum.   Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with small openings were seen in the descending colon.  Impression: Mass in the cecum (biopsy)Diverticulosis of the descending colonPrevious end to end ___ anastomosis of the sigmoid colonOtherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and terminal ileum .PATHOLOGY:DIAGNOSIS: \"Cecal mass\", mucosal biopsies: Colonic mucosa with focal ischemic change and abundant associated ulceration, exudate, and granulation tissue formation; no carcinoma or dysplasia in these samples.  Five levels are examined.  BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:The patient is a ___ year-old female with history significant for diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection in ___, who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have cecal mass.  .  # Abdominal pain: Was most likely related to hemorrhagic ovarian cyst.  Initially, patient had significant pain that was not relieved with dilaudid.  However, over the course of several days her pain resolved on its own and she no longer required any pain medications.  Bloodwork and imaging were not suggestive of any intra-abdominal infection.  The patient was advised to follow-up with her gynecologist regarding her ovarian cyst, and the need for continued therapy with low dose oral contraceptive.   .  # Cecal Mass: During the workup of this patient's abdominal pain, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 3 cm cecal mass concerning for malignancy.  During this hospitalization she underwent colonoscopy with biopsy of the mass.  She was instructed to follow-up with her outpatient gastroenterologist regarding the results of this biopsy in one week.  The biopsy was negative for malignancy.   .  # Anxiety - Patient was continued on home regimen of zoloft and ativan.  .  # Gerd - Patient continued on omeprazole, zantac BID per outpatient regimen.
